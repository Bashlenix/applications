# Hey there, I'm your match 😁!

If you’re here, you just have found not only the working student you've been looking for, but a winning investment too (promis 😉). I’m <strong>Muhammad Otah Bashi</strong>, and I’m excited about the opportunity to work with Carealytix, combining my skills in software engineering with my passion for improving healthcare. I believe we could be a great match—here's why:

## 🚀 Why I’m Your Match

The short answer is : I believe I check all the boxes 🤓.  I’m currently studying Health Informatics at ECRI Pfarrkirchen. I have hands-on experience in software testing and I have been learning <span style="color:#756464; font-weight:bold">Python</span>, <span style="color:#756464; font-weight:bold">JavaScript (ReactJS)</span> and <span style="color:#756464; font-weight:bold">Git</span>.

I’m eager to dive into meaningful projects that impact real people, and Carealytix’s mission to improve the lives of those with chronic kidney disease <span style="color:red">(CKD)</span> resonates deeply with me.

## 💡 What I Can Bring to the Team

* **Technical expertise:** Good foundation in programming and web development with a focus on creating scalable, clean code.

* **Growth mindset:** I'm a speedy learner ⚡, always open for feedback and eager to learn new technologies and development practices, and I’m excited about the opportunity to work alongside experienced developers at Carealytix.

* **A passion for healthcare:** Being a Health Informatics student myself, I’m committed to building technology that can positively impact patients' lives and improve medical outcomes.

**Multilingual communication 🌍:** Fluent in English, Arabic, and Turkish, and actively learning German to better collaborate in diverse, international teams.
